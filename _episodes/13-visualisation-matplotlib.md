The mathematician Richard Hamming once said, "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers," and
the best way to develop insight is often to visualize data.  Visualization deserves an entire
lecture of its own, but we can explore a few features of Python's `matplotlib` library here.  While
there is no official plotting library, `matplotlib` is the _de facto_ standard.

## Visualising our Inflammation Data

First, we will import the `pyplot` module from `matplotlib` and use two of its functions to create and display a heat map of our data:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot
image = matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(data)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

FIXME: add Heatmap of the Data ../fig/01-numpy_71_0.png

Blue pixels in this heat map represent low values, while yellow pixels represent high values. As we can see, inflammation rises and falls over a 40-day period.

Let's take a look at the average inflammation over time:

~~~
ave_inflammation = numpy.mean(data, axis=0)
ave_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(ave_inflammation)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

FIXME: add Average Inflammation Over Time ../fig/01-numpy_73_0.png

Here, we have put the average per day across all patients in the variable `ave_inflammation`, then asked `matplotlib.pyplot` to create and display a line graph of those values.  The result is a roughly linear rise and fall, which is suspicious: we might instead expect a sharper rise and slower fall.  Let's have a look at two other statistics:

~~~
max_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

FIXME: add Maximum Value Along The First Axis ../fig/01-numpy_75_1.png

~~~
min_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

FIXME: add Minimum Value Along The First Axis ../fig/01-numpy_75_3.png

The maximum value rises and falls smoothly, while the minimum seems to be a step function. Neither trend seems particularly likely, so either there's a mistake in our calculations or something is wrong with our data. This insight would have been difficult to reach by examining the numbers themselves without visualization tools.

## Multiple Plots: Single Graph

Perhaps we want to compare the minimum, maximum, and average plots overlayed together. This would allow us to see the range of values across each day in the trial. Let's use PyCharm to build a script called `overlay_graphs.py` that positions our three graphs in a single plot, or 'figure'.

So Matplotlib divides a figure object up into axes: each pair of axes is one 'subplot'. To make a boring figure with just one pair of axes, however, we can just ask for a default new figure, with brand new axes. The `subplots()` function returns a (figure, axis) pair, which we can deal out with parallel assignment.

Given we have a stacked set of graphs in a single figure, we use `legend()` on our axes to add one which uses our given plot labels.

~~~
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')

all_graphs, all_graphs_axes = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()

all_graphs_axes.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0), label='average')
all_graphs_axes.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0), label='max')
all_graphs_axes.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0), label='min')
all_graphs_axes.legend()

matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

FIXME: add generated combined plot


## Multiple Plots: Multiple Graphs

We can also group similar plots within a single figure using subplots next to each other within that figure. Let's use PyCharm to build another script called `multiple_graphs.py` that positions our three graphs side-by-side and introduces a number of new commands.

The function `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()` creates a space into which we will place all of our plots. The parameter `figsize` tells Python how big to make this space.

Each subplot is placed into the figure using its `add_subplot` method. The `add_subplot` method takes 3 parameters. The first denotes how many total rows of subplots there are, the second parameter refers to the total number of subplot columns, and the final parameter denotes which subplot your variable is referencing (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).

Each subplot is stored in a different variable (`axes1`, `axes2`, `axes3`). Once a subplot is created, the axes can be titled using the `set_xlabel()` command (or `set_ylabel()`).

~~~
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')

fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

avg_axes = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
max_axes = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
min_axes = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

avg_axes.set_ylabel('average')
avg_axes.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))

max_axes.set_ylabel('max')
max_axes.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))

min_axes.set_ylabel('min')
min_axes.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))

fig.tight_layout()

matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

FIXME: add The Previous Plots as Subplots ../fig/01-numpy_80_0.png

The call to `loadtxt` reads our data, and the rest of the program tells the plotting library how large we want the figure to be, that we're creating three subplots, what to draw for each one, and that we want a tight layout. (If we leave out that call to `fig.tight_layout()`, the graphs will actually be squeezed together more closely.)

## Saving our Plots

We can also save our plots to disk. Let's change our `overlay_graphs.py` script to do that, by adding the following just before we call `matplotlib.pyplot.show()`:

~~~
all_graphs.savefig('overlay_graphs.png')
~~~
{: .language-python}

When we re-run the script, you should see a new `overlay_graphs.png` file in the same directory as the script.
