## Why is Python so popular for research work?

MATLAB typically the most popular "language of technical computing":

- Support for efficient numerical analysis with matrices, plotting
- Other dynamic languages have cleaner, more logical syntax (Ruby, Haskell).

## The Scientific Python Trilogy

But Python users developed three critical libraries:

- IPython, precursor of the Notebook, created by Fernando Perez
- NumPy, fast matrix maths library created by Travis Oliphant
- Matplotlib, plotting library created by John D. Hunter

All available as a free and open toolchain.

## Advantages of Numpy Arrays over Python Lists

- Less memory - smaller memory footprint
- Faster - often order of magnitude faster
- Convenience - supports powerful matrix and scientific operations

Tradeoff is *flexibility*.
